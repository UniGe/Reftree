systemPythons contain the following files: 

-Sport.py -> define and creates the objects to be passed to fill the template 
-createAndReturnFiles.py -> gets the newly created files and saves them to the correct location.

both these files should be located on the AppUploadPath\PythonScripts such that the application runs properly


the files in the . folder should be uploaded through the app on the "Tipo usicte" (OutputType) function with the corrisponding template (if you add new scripts please name the template = as the name of the python script)
